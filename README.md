# phase_01_Project : Exploratory Data Analysis on Movie Data
  The motivation for this project was to exoplore the movie data in order to determine how Microsoft a tech giant can manouever into the movie business by exploring 
  the most profitable movies in terms of what are the genres of the most profitable, what period of release dtranslate into the most profits and to investigate whethe r or not length of a movie has any bearing on profits. My problems were centered around understanding what movies generate  profits
  
  Procedure
  I began by extracting the relevant data i required from the various datasets using csv methods.I then cleaned the columns by dropping null whenever necessary and removing or replacing outliers. I also created new columns such as profits by subtracting budgets from the gross income. I also used string methods to come up with cleaner categorical data
   I then proceeded to visualize the data using seaborn 
   
   Challenges
   I did not find a lot data visualization methods that are friendly to categorical data
   
   Conclusions
   From my visualisations i concluded that the mosgt profitable genre is action movies and the most profitable releases were in winter and not summer and that movie length doesn't affect profits.
